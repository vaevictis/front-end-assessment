# Code Assessment for Front-end Engineer

## Goal

The goal of this technical assessment is to evaluate ability and core competency in
areas relevant to the front-end development at EventMobi. These include:
- Ability to use JavaScript MVC frameworks to interact with APIs.
- Competence with creation and implementation of basic designs.
- Aptitude with HTML and CSS to create clean, readable and performant code.

Through the completion of this test, you will be able to demonstrate your abilities as a developer.

## Details
- Use the API provided by GitHub Gist API (which is documented here), create a basic website as a single-page app with React.
- Your task is to use Gist API to create a simple single-page application. A user should be able to enter a username and get the full list of public Gists for that user. The following are a list of functional requirements for this assignment:
- Search: When a user enters a username, it should be able to get a full list of public Gists by that user.
- Filetype: Convert the filetypes of the files in the gist into a tag/badge, (e.g, if the returned gist has list of files containing python and JavaScript files, the gist should have the respective tags/badges).
- Fork: Username/Avatar of the last 3 users who forked it with avatar linking to the fork.

The application should follow a plan implemented by you and if constrained by time, mention the potential improvements rather than spending excessive time on them.
